//Get all img srcs in html/xml with xpath and javascript and copy array of values to clipboard in the browser console.  
//Tested in firefox.

copy($x("//img/@src").map(n => n.value).join("\n"))

//explanation

//$x(xpath, element, resultType)    <-$x() signature
$x() is a browser console command - part of the built-in helper functions
//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Helpers

//xpath path
"//img/@src"   means get all img children elements and get the src attributes (as a string)?
The $x returns 
$x("//img/@src") returns an array of objects of type Attr
The Attr object has various keys. The src key is the one that is in the array element.
The array has "src='string of url or data etc'"  items.
The useful keys are the value and textContent keys of the Attr object.

Now, we have to transform those array items into strings with a chained method - .map(n => n.value)
We use the fat arrow notation - an arrow function expression.
//The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array
//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
The map method takes a value (n) and returns the 'value' property of the argument n.

We then join the items in the array with a new line ready for output.
copy() is a console built-in helper function. It copies the inner variable/item to the clipboard.
